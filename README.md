# Bigger Coding Exercise

My objective is to create an app that displays a random dog image, and links
to 10 random dog pictures on the bottom, labeled by their breed.

API documentation: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/

## Set up

1.  `cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install dependencies
2.  Run `node app.js` to start the application. Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.
3.  Run `npm test` to test all test specs.
